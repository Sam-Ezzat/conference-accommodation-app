## Feature Integration Logic

### Dashboard Feature Connections:

1. **Event Dashboard** → Creates/Manages Events
2. **Form Builder** → Creates registration forms for Events
3. **Accommodation Dashboard** → Manages properties/rooms for Events
4. **Transportation Dashboard** → Manages transport options for Events
5. **Reservation Dashboard** → Processes registrations from Forms
6. **Room Assignment** → Assigns Participants to Rooms
7. **Participant Management** → Manages all attendee data
8. **Reports & Analytics** → Generates insights from all data

### Key Business Rules:

1. **One Event → Multiple Forms** (but typically one main registration form)
2. **One Event → Multiple Accommodations** (different hotels/properties)
3. **One Event → Multiple Transportation Options**
4. **One Reservation → Multiple Participants** (family bookings)
5. **One Room → Multiple Participants** (shared accommodation)
6. **One Transport → Multiple Participants** (group travel)
