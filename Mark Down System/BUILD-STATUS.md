## 🔧 Current Status

The basic foundation is complete and ready for feature development. The application structure follows modern React best practices with:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with types, components, pages, and utilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for better development experience
- **Modern Tooling**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first design
- **Scalable Structure**: Modular architecture ready for large-scale features

## 🚀 Next Development Phase

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Start Development Server**: 
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\SAM-PC\Accommodation System\conference-accommodation-app"
   npm run dev
   ```
   OR double-click `start-dev.bat`

2. **Fix PostCSS Issues**: The server may need PostCSS configuration adjustments

3. **Begin Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement actual Dashboard with real data
   - Add drag-and-drop room assignment interface
   - Create event management forms
   - Build attendee registration system

### Next Sprint Priorities:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Implementation**: 
   - Create DraggableAttendee components
   - Implement DroppableRoom components  
   - Build AssignmentBoard with conflict detection

2. **State Management Setup**:
   - Configure Zustand stores for global state
   - Implement API client with React Query
   - Add authentication system

3. **Real Data Integration**:
   - Connect to backend API (Flask or Node.js)
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add form validation
